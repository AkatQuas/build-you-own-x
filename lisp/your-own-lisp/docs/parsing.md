> There are actually two ways to include files in C. One is using angular brackets `<>` as we've seen so far, and the other is with quotation marks `""`.
>
>  The only difference between the two is that using angular brackets searches the system locations for headers first, while quotation marks searches the current directory first. Because of this system headers such as `<stdio.h>` are typically put in angular brackets, while local headers such as `"mpc.h"` are typically put in quotation marks.
