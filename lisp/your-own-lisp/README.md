# Build Your Own Lisp

The whole online [documents](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/contents).

What I learned from this tutorial?

It provides me a different perspective on think about programming language.

Evaluation is a big part of the interpreted language like JavaScript.

Many statements like `if () {} else {}` , `switch () {}` are just builtin functions rather than a language structure.

And it's not a hard work to create a LISP of one's own.
